# Start Local Development Server:
   Using the command npm start.

# Api Service used:
    News Api: The api has limited usage, after that it was unable to call for any data. Other sources are either paid or lack documentation.

# Tech Stack:
    React, Tailwind, Axios.

# Code Structure:
    I use Components to build the parts of the app then place them into the pages. Ensuring I have a Global state to pass data from
    one component to other. Other ways include passing through props.
